## Aquaculture sub-goal
Aquacultue index measures sustainable production of farmed fish in northern Norway.
The table below explains the structure of aquacuture goal: the components of the goal and the  data layers used to estimate them.

Component of the goal|Data layers description|Temporal coverage|Data source|
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
|Production|Standing biomass of salmon and trout per municipality each month; amount of fish lost during the production|2005-2018|The Fisheries Directorate of Norway|
|Fish lost during production|Amount of fish died, escaped or lost due to other reasons during production each year|2005-2018|The Fisheries Directorate of Norway|
|Lice abundance|Average lice abundane at a farm, compared to thresholds abundance|2005-2018|Norwegian Marine Data Center, Barentswatch.no portal|
|MOM B examinations|The category of environmental impact at a farm from very good (1) to bery bad (4)|2005-2018|The Fisheries Directorate of Norway|
|Economic feed conversion ratio (eFCR) |Consumption of feed per municipality each year|2005-2015|The Fisheries Directorate of Norway|


### Estimating sustainable aquacultlure
Aquaculutre goal consists of two components: total production and sustainability indices. When both components are calculated, they are combined into the amout of aquacutllure production (in tonns og kg) produced sustainably.

Below is the description of each component of the aquaculture sub-goal.


**Annual production**

**Lice prevalence**
