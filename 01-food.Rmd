## Aquaculture sub-goal
Aquacultue index measures sustainable production of farmed fish in northern Norway.
The table below explains the structure of aquacuture goal: the components of the goal and the  data layers used to estimate them.

Component of the goal|Data layers description|Temporal coverage|Data source|
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
|Production|Standing biomass of salmon and trout per municipality each month; amount of fish lost during the production|2005-2018|The Fisheries Directorate of Norway|
|Fish lost during production|Amount of fish died, escaped or lost due to other reasons during production each year|2005-2018|The Fisheries Directorate of Norway|
|Lice abundance|Average lice abundane at a farm, compared to thresholds abundance|2005-2018|Norwegian Marine Data Center, Barentswatch.no portal|
|MOM B examinations|The category of environmental impact at a farm from very good (1) to bery bad (4)|2005-2018|The Fisheries Directorate of Norway|
|Economic feed conversion ratio (eFCR) |Consumption of feed per municipality each year|2005-2015|The Fisheries Directorate of Norway|


### Estimating sustainable aquacultlure
Aquaculutre goal consists of two components: total production and sustainability indices. When both components are calculated, they are combined into the amout of aquacutllure production (in tonns og kg) produced sustainably.

Below is the description of each component of the aquaculture sub-goal.

**Annual production**
We caclulated total annual aquaculture production per municipality, as follows:
$Tot.prod = \triangle Biomass + Harvest - Discard - Seeded\ smolts$

Biomass change and harvest  were corrected for slaugher weight, by multiplying their weight by 0.88.
The weight of smolts was assumed to be 100 gramms, and the weight of discarded salmon - **5x0.88 = 4.4**  kg.

Where, $\triangle Biomass$ is the difference of standing biomass of fish in December of the given year minus December of the previous year, $Harvest$ is biomass of fish harvested (kg); $Seeded\ smolts$ is the biomass of smolts (kg), seeded for production at the beginning of the production cycle; $Discard$ is the biomass of fish (kg) discarded at the slaughter plant, and Removed is the biomass of fish (kg) removed from the cages for slaughtering at another location or for other reasons 

$\triangle Biomass$ is the difference between standing biomass of fish in Desember of a given year minus standing biomass in Desember of the previous year. When it was not possible to subtract standing biomass of the previous year, for instance, when there was no fish in the cages at the end of the previous year, we calculated the difference between earliest and latest month of the give year, when there were fish in the cages.

For some municipalities, the total annual aquacultlure production was negative, due to underestimnation of fish biomass. In these cases, the total production was set to a missing value (NA). These missing values were replaced with a nearest observed produciton (either of the previous or of the following year). 
Of the 81 coastal municipalities in Northern Norway, 10 did not have aquaculture in any of the studied years (1994 - 2018):

* Andoy
* Berlavag
* Hemnes
* Malselv
* Prosanger
* Rost
* Tana
* Vado
* Vaeroy
* Vardo

**Economic feed conversion ratio (eFCR)**
Economic feed conversion ratio (eFCR) is the ratio of the amount of feed used during the produciton of fish, to the final biomass of fish released to the market [@boyd2007indicators].

$eFCR = \frac{Feed \ used,\ kg}{Biomass\ produced,\ kg}$

We calculated eFCR as a ratio of total feed used for production in a county (Norwegian "fylke"), to the total biomass of fish produced annually in the county. The total feed consumption and total biomass produced per region were calculated as a sum of feed consumption and produced biomass of all municipalities within the county.
